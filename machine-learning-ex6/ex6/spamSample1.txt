Dear Suhas,

In furtherance of your request for an internship at Walnut Knowledge Solutions, we are delighted to offer you an internship for the period of one month, commencing on the 20th of September 2017 and ending on the 18th of October 2017. The terms of your internship are as follows:

    You will be required to provide a minimum set of fifteen quality questions at the end of every week of the internship, preferably on Saturday evening. The questions will be reviewed and you will be given feedback after each set. You can then upload the content on a Google Drive link we'll share with you.
    You will be required to conduct a full quiz for the members of Team Walnut at the end of the internship.
    The topics for research for questions will be indicated to you in advance.
    You will also assist with the technology initiatives of Walnut.
    You will be required to do one book review and present it along with the end of internship quiz. You can choose the book and let us know. Alternatively, we can choose the book for you.
    A stipend along with any expenses incurred on behalf of Walnut during the internship will be provided to you at the end of the internship.
    We believe in good faith that the questions submitted by you are original in content. Mentioning the source (as a link) of the question would go a long way towards providing that question with authenticity. Please also avoid submitting questions which you have used elsewhere previously.
    We also believe in good faith that the questions submitted are for the sole use of Walnut. We would prefer that these questions not be used in any other event.
    You will be liaising with Vaishnavi from our team.

​I have attached a sample question and a template for your use. If you have any questions, please feel free to call any of us for clarifications, ideas et al.
​
​Looking forward to working with you, ​
